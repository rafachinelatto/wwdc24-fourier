# Fourier Drawing 

## The app
My app idea originated from my experiences in the electrical engineering course and a strong desire to share knowledge. In electrical engineering, we frequently encounter the Fourier transformâ€”a powerful and intriguing mathematical tool, though challenging to comprehend.
   
During my initial exposure to the Fourier transform, the intricate calculations left me perplexed, lacking apparent coherence. However, with continuous study, a newfound understanding transformed my perception, and I began to appreciate its incredible significance.
 
Motivated by this journey, I aspired to develop an app that not only imparts knowledge but also conveys the sense of awe I experienced upon truly grasping the concept. 
 
To achieve this goal, I adopted a more visual approach, steering away from the intimidating calculations that often deter learners. This way, I aim to highlight the beauty inherent in this mathematical tool, making it more accessible and captivating for a broader audience.
 
And what enables me to develop the app exactly as intended is the knowledge I continue to acquire through my participation in the Apple Developer Academy in Campinas, Brazil.

## How to run it
Download the ZIP file and open the .swiftpm file using Xcode. This app is designed to run on an iPhone with iOS 16.0 or later; you can also run it in a simulator if desired.

## About the autor
  My name is Rafael Chinelatto, currently studying Electrical Engineering at Unicamp. I'm part of the 2023 class at the Apple Developer Academy in Campinas, Brazil.
	I have always been very interested in the field of education. During my school years, I consistently did my best to assist my classmates. When I entered university, I had my first real encounter with programming where I learned Python, and that's when I fell in love with the field, realizing the abundant opportunities it brings.
	Throughout the course, I delved deeper into programming, particularly low-level programming focused on microprocessors, sparking a strong interest in robotics. 
	Consequently, I joined a robotics study group, combining two passions: education and robotics. In this group, we worked on diverse robotics projects, including robot soccer in the VSSS category. There was also a social project, introducing robotics to public school students through workshops. These experiences were enriching and contributed significantly to my personal growth.
	Last year, I fulfilled another dream by delving deeper into programming; I joined the Apple Developer Academy, where I've been learning extensively about app development. This opportunity allows me to create applications that have the potential to positively impact the world for the better.
